# Intro
Global warming has already progressed to the point where the water table is rising relentlessly. Thank God, mankind has accumulated so much garbage over the centuries that garbage is available as an infinite resource. The only way out of dying by drowning is to fill up the entire planet in order to gradually escape the rising water level.

# Fun Facts
This game was created as part of the GameDevWeek Trier. This is so to say a GameJam of the University of Trier, which lasts one week (duh). There were eight of us in this project. My task was, among other things, to lead the team and implement the placement of the blocks, as well as UI adjustments. 
It was the first "real" game I implemented in a team.
